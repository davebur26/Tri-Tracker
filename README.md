# Tri Tack
This application was writen in Java and was made during my second project week at Codeclan. 
## Brief
The application provides the user with a method of capturing triathlon specific workouts and 
carrying out a range of statistical analyse on athletes. The statisics include;
- quickest run for a set distance in a set month and/or year
- best relay team combination for different competition types
## Future Work
I intend to extend the code so that it interacts with a SQLite database. I would also like to add a user interface in Android 
to make the application easier to use.
